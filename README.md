HIGHER LOWER GAME

DESCRIPTION:
IN THIS GAME TWO ENTITIES ARE COMPARED AND A USER IS ASKED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO ENTITIES OR CELEBRITIES AS TO WHICH ONE HAS MORE FOLLOWERS (the data is preserved in a presdefined dictionary)
ON GUESSING CORRECT THE USER SCORE INCREMENTS TO 1 AND ADDS 1 WITH EVERY CORRECT GUESS. WHEN THE GUESS IS INCORRECT THE GAME ENDS ELSE IT CONTINUES TO COMPARE.WHEN THE GAME ENDS YOU GET YOUR FINAL 
SCORE.

HOW DID I MADE THIS:
BASICALLY I HAVE DEFINED THREE FUNCTIONS AND THOSE ARE
def format_data (which is used to display info about the entity but not the followers)
def check_answer(checks answer)
